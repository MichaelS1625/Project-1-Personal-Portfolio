      <p>Hello, my name is Michael Singleton and I wellcome you to my web portfolio. If you would like to contact, you can do so by using this email:<a href="michaelsingleton4@bears.mybrcc.edu"><br><strong><em>michaelsingleton4@bears.mybrcc.edu</em></strong></br></a></p>
      <p>My concentration now in college are Computer Science, Computer Networking, and Entertainment Technology. After I gradute from college I plan on going into the Video Game Industry and use my skills for working on games. I've always wanted to make a career in the Video Game Industry since I grew up playing video games, and I would like to create something that make people happy to play games. If not, I would like to build my own gaming headsets and run my own busniess with anything related to my orignal goal.</p>
      <p>For things that I do for fun are mostly just playing games, hanging out with friends, sightseeing, working and learning a game engine like Unreal Engine 4 for personal projects, learning to 3D model in 3D softwares like Blender, and discovering new developments of Technology. I have developed my skills in 3D modeling to be better, here are some examples of my works.</p>
